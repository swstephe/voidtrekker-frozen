Here I have another design for t-shirts, stickers and tote bags.  It is based on the very
common t-shirt design which show anthopomorphized condiments of foods with the text "best friends".
I just thought that it would be neat to have the Indonesian equivalent, as I usually see the two
bottles of "Kecap Manis", (sweet soy sauce), and "Sambal Asli", (original-style chili pepper sauce).

Usually, these kinds of designs have the words "Friends Forever" or "Best Friends" next to it,
but I wasn't sure how to translate it or whether it was needed.  I actually had another version
which got into far too much detail to show specific popular brands.  The "kecap manis" was from
a company called "Bango", and the "sambal" from was from a company called "ABC".  I wasn't sure
if it would violate copyrights to accurately draw the labels on each bottle, (I think I spent 5
hours digitizing the Bango crane).  The bottle itself says it the company has been around for a long time.
In the end, I deleted all the labels and simplified some of the details.  I was told that the color
of the caps and shape of bottle would be necessary for people to recognize what they were.

I made the stick figure parts myself, with the idea that it would be suitable even for children's
clothes.  I wanted to make it look like one of them had just told a joke and the other was laughing
at it.
